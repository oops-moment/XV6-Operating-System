# SYSTEM CALLS

* trace

    ```C
        int trace(int mask_value);
    ```
    > ` strace mask command [args]`
    * It intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a process during its
    execution.
    * User program strace added which runs the specified command till it exits.
    * Made changes to sysproc.c, usys.pl, syscall.c, syscall.h and user.h.  

    * Changes made to implement trace:
        * Edited &nbsp; ```sysproc.c``` to add function &nbsp; ```sys_trace()```.
        * Edited &nbsp; ```syscall.c```  and &nbsp; ```syscall.h``` to add the system call &nbsp; ```trace```.
        * Created &nbsp; ```strace.c```
        in &nbsp; ```user``` to add the user program &nbsp; ```strace() ```.
        * Edited &nbsp; ```usys.pl``` to add system call &nbsp; ```trace```.
         // user.h mei prototypew
 
* sigalarm and sigreturn
    
    ```C
        int sigalarm(int interval, void (*handler)());
        int sigreturn();
    ```

    * Added the system calls sigalarm and sigreturn.
    * sigalarm periodically interrupts the function after interval ticks and calls the handler function.
    * sigreturn resets the process state to before the handler function was called.
    * Made changes to sysproc.c, proc.c and trap.c.
    * Changes made to implement sigalarm and sigreturn:
        * Edited &nbsp; ```sysproc.c``` to add the functions &nbsp; ```sys_sigalarm()``` and &nbsp; ```sys_sigreturn()```.
        * Edited &nbsp; ```usys.pl``` to add system calls &nbsp; ```sigalarm``` and &nbsp; ```sigreturn```.
        * Added &nbsp; ```int sig_alarm_flag```, &nbsp; ```int input_ticks```, &nbsp; ```int count_ticks ```, &nbsp; ```uint64 handler ``` and &nbsp; ```struct trapframe *trapframe_temp;``` in &nbsp; ```proc.h```.
        * Initialised the newly added variable in &nbsp; ```allocproc()``` in &nbsp; ```proc.c```.
        *  Edited &nbsp; ```usertrap()``` in &nbsp; ```trap.c``` to reset alarm conditions after interrupt occurs.

# SCHEDULING

* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
    * FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm which schedules the process that comes first without giving any particular priority to a process.
    * Changes made to implement FCFS:
        * Added &nbsp; ```createTime```  to &nbsp; ```struct proc``` in &nbsp; ```proc.h``` to store the creation time of a process.
        * Initialised the newly added variable in &nbsp; ```allocproc()``` in &nbsp; ```proc.c```.
        * Ran a for loop in &nbsp; ```scheduler()``` in order to select a runnable process with the lowest creation time to implement the FCFS algorithm.
        *  Added &nbsp; ```#ifdef``` conditions in &nbsp; ```kerneltrap()``` in &nbsp; ```trap.c``` to disable preemption.

* Lottery Based Scheduling (LBS)
    * LBS is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that assigns a time slice to the process randomly in proportion to the number of tickets it owns. That is the probability that the process runs
    in a given time slice is proportional to the number of tickets owned by it.

    * Changes made to implement LBS: 
        * Added &nbsp; ```int tickets``` to &nbsp; ```struct proc``` in &nbsp; ```proc.h``` to store the number of tickets a process has.
        * Initialised the newly added variable in &nbsp; ```allocproc()``` in &nbsp; ```proc.c```.
        * Added &nbsp; ```#ifdef``` conditions to &nbsp; ```scheduler()``` to implement LBS.
            * Declared and initialsed the variables &nbsp; ```total_tickets``` and &nbsp; ```lottery```. 
            * ```total_tickets``` stores the total number of tickets owned by all processes.
            * The &nbsp; ```random()``` fuction in proc.c assigns a random lottery number to &nbsp; ```lottery```.
            * We check which process has higher number of tickets by subtracting &nbsp; ```p->tickets``` from &nbsp; ```lottery``` and checking which process makes it negative, since a process with higher number of tickets is more likely to make &nbsp; ```lottery``` negative and thus it is scheduled.
        * Interrupts are enabled for LBS scheduling since it is preeptive. Thus added LBS to the &nbsp; ```#ifdef``` for allowing interrupts in &nbsp; ```kerneltrap()``` in &nbsp; ```trap.c```.
        * Added the system call &nbsp; ```settickets``` to set the tickets for a calling process.

* Priority Based Scheduler (PBS)
    * PBS is a non-preemptive priority-based scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the highest priority (lowest &nbsp; ```dynamic_priority```) for execution. 
    * In case two or more processes have the same priority, we use the number of times the process has been scheduled to break the tie. 
    * If the tie remains, we use &nbsp; ```createTime``` of the process to break the tie.

    * Changes made to implement PBS:
        * Added &nbsp; ```exitTime, runTime, waitTime, sleepTime, sleepTime, totalRunTime, num_runs, priority ``` to &nbsp; ```struct proc``` in &nbsp; ```proc.h``` to store the required parameters a process needs for PBS scheduling.
        * Initialised the newly added variable in &nbsp; ```allocproc()``` in &nbsp; ```proc.c```.
        * Added &nbsp; ```#ifdef``` conditions to &nbsp; ```scheduler()``` to implement PBS.
            * We wish to find the process with the minimum &nbsp; ```dynamic_priority```. Thus, it is first initialised to 101 (the max priority).
            * For each process, we calculate the niceness of the process given by the formula 
            > niceness = Int (Ticks spent in (sleeping) state / Ticks spent in (sleeping + running) state) * 10
            * We then calculate dynamic priority using the formula (DP is dynamic priority and SP is static priority)
            > DP = max(0, min(SP - niceness + 5, 100))
            <br>
            * The comparing priority is taken to be the dynamic priority of a process.
            * We select a process based on the above given tie-breaking conditions and schedule it.
            *  Added &nbsp; ```#ifdef``` conditions in &nbsp; ```kerneltrap()``` in &nbsp; ```trap.c``` to disable preemption.

        * Implemented the &nbsp; ```set_priority``` system call which resets niceness to 5 and returns the old static priority.
        * Implemented the user program &nbsp; ```setpriority``` to run the system call.

* Multi Level Feedback Queue Scheduler (MLFQ)
    * MLFQ is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that allows processes to move between different priority queues based on their behaviour and CPU bursts.

    * Changes made to implement MLFQ (in proc.h, proc.c and trap.c):
        * Added &nbsp; ```int queue_priority, int in_queue, in time_quanta, int nrun, int qitime, int qrtime[5]``` to struct proc in &nbsp; ```proc.h```. 
        * Declared an array &nbsp; ```struct queue``` &nbsp; ```mlfq[5]``` in &nbsp; ```proc.c```.
        * Defined standard queue operation functions like pop and push in &nbsp; ```proc.c```. Initialised each queue in the array (the &nbsp; ```head, tail and no_processes```).
        * Initialised the added parameters for MLFQ in &nbsp; ```allocproc()``` in &nbsp; ```proc.c```.
        * MLFQ was implemented as follows:
            * On the initiation of a process, it is pushed to the end of the highest priority queue (queue 0).
            * Process in highest priority non empty queues are scheduled.
            * If the process uses the complete time slice assigned for its current priority queue, it is preempted and inserted at the end of the next lower level queue.
            * If a process voluntarily relinquishes control of the CPU(eg. For doing I/O), it leaves the queuing network, and when the process becomes ready again after the I/O, it is inserted at the tail of the same queue, from which it is relinquished earlier.
            * A round-robin scheduler is used for processes at the lowest priority queue.
            * To prevent starvation, aging is implemented where if the process waits for more than 64 ticks, it's priority is increased.

    * Answer to the question:
        * MLFQ scheduling is based on the timeslice used by a process.
        * If a process has used all its time quanta, then the process is demoted to a lower priority queue.
        * When a process leaves CPU to perform an I/O, it is possible it uses up its timeslice and is demoted. However, by adding the process at the end of the queue it was already present in, this can be prevented.
        * Thus the process wont have to wait for a longer time in order to get CPU attention after finishing its I/O bursts.

# COPY ON WRITE       
* Cow fork will creates just a page table for the child , with PTEs for user memory pointing to the parentâ€™s pa. Cow fork will marks all the user PTEs in both parent and child as not writable. When either process wants to write any of these unwritable pages, will triggle a page fault .The kernel trap will handle this fault , allocates a page of physical memory for the page fault,copies the original page into the new page, and modifies the relevant PTE in the faulting process to refer to the new page.

* To acheive the above goal changes were made to uvmcopy in vm.c where the copy of page table was created and pointer pointed out to the new copy , previous page was freed as by kfree.

* We maintain the refcnt(reference count array ) for every physical page .In the initialization , the refcnt will be writedto 1,because in the freerange ,we call kfree which decreases the refcnt for every pa.

* Increase refcnt and kfree is a combination , which is increase the refcnt of the pa , the other is decrease the refcnt of the pa .In the case when the refcnt of the pa down to zero , we would then free the pa .

* Kalloc function will allocate a pa , if the pa ref cnt is not valid , ie if it's already non zero then it gives panic since can it be already allocated memory.

* Now in trap.c we handled the page fault as he r_scause of page fault is 15 or 13. In usertrap , we have cowfault function that handles it .

* handle the invalid va , more than MAXVA , not in the page table ,not set user bit or valid bit
allocate a new pa , copy the original content to the new pa , unmap and map for this pte entry!
